`fishpals` : Species-specific Fish Color Palettes for Plots

Modeled after Karthik Ram's [`wesanderson`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=wesanderson) palettes package, methods areprovided to create species-specific color palettes generated from pictures of fish that [Cramer Fish Sciences](http://www.fishsciences.net/) (CFS) has worked with in the past. Since CFS works mostly with North American, northwestern fish species, we're talking about a lot of greens, browns, and grays. But we're open to adding some tropical palettes.
