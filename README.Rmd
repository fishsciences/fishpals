# fishpals: fish color palettes, themes, and scales (ha!) for plots

Heavily influenced by Diane Cook's `ochre` package and Karthik Ram's `wesanderson` package, this package provides color palettes and some lightweight ggplot2 themes. Since Cramer Fish Sciences works mostly with North American/northwestern fish species, we're talking about a lot of greens, browns, and grays. But we're open to adding some tropical palettes.

## Usage

    devtools::install_github('fishciences/fishpals')
    library(fishpals)
    library(ggplot2)
    
    ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Width, Sepal.Length)) +
       geom_point(size = 4.5, aes(color = Species), show.legend = FALSE) +
       scale_color_fishpals("greensunfish") +
       theme_pres()

See `?fishpals::theme_report` for all available themes and `?fishpals::scale_color_fishpals` for available `ggplot2` scales.
