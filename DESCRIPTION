Title: A Package of Fish Color Palettes for Plots
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Myfanwy Johnston
Maintainer: Myfanwy Johnston <myfanwy.johnston@fishsciences.net>
Description: Modeled after Karthik Ram's wesanderson palettes package, this package provides species-specific 
    color palettes generated from pictures of fish that Cramer Fish Sciences has worked with in the past.  Since CFS
    works mostly with North American, northwestern fish species, we're talking about a lot of greens, browns, and grays.
    But we're open to adding some tropical palettes.
