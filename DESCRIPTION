Title: Fish Color Palettes, Scales (ha!), and Themes for Plots
Version: 0.2.0
Author: Myfanwy Johnston, Bob Rudis
Maintainer: Myfanwy Johnston <myfanwy.johnston@fishsciences.net>
Description: Heavily influenced by Diane Cook's `ochre` package and Karthik Ram's `wesanderson` package, this package
    provides species-specific color palettes (generated from pictures of fish 
    that 'Cramer Fish Sciences' ('CFS') has worked with in the past), and some lightweight ggplot2 themes. Since 'CFS' works 
    mostly with North American, northwestern fish species, we're talking about a lot of 
    greens, browns, and grays. But we're open to adding some tropical palettes.
