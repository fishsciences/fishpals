Description: Heavily influenced by Diane Cook's `ochre` package and Karthik Ram's `wesanderson` package, this package
    provides species-specific color palettes (generated from pictures of fish 
    that 'Cramer Fish Sciences' ('CFS') has worked with in the past), and some lightweight ggplot2 themes.
