Title: Species-specific Fish Color Palettes for Plots
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Myfanwy Johnston
Maintainer: Myfanwy Johnston <myfanwy.johnston@fishsciences.net>
Description: Modeled after Karthik Ram's 'wesanderson' palettes package, methods are
    provided to create species-specific color palettes generated from pictures of fish 
    that 'Cramer Fish Sciences' ('CFS') has worked with in the past. Since 'CFS' works 
    mostly with North American, northwestern fish species, we're talking about a lot of 
    greens, browns, and grays. But we're open to adding some tropical palettes.
